# Code of Conduct

We’re committed to a friendly, safe, and welcoming community.

- Be respectful; assume good intent.
- No harassment, hate speech, or discrimination.
- Keep feedback constructive; review code, not people.
- If there’s a problem, open an issue or contact a maintainer.

**Enforcement:** Maintainers may moderate content and behavior at their discretion. Repeated or severe violations may lead to moderation actions, including issue/PR locks or bans.

**Scope:** Applies to all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, and any community channels).
